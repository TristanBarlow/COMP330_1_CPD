\section{Introduction}
My experience of free lance app development has put into perspective some of the challenges one faces when dealing with real world deadlines. In addition, it allowed me to see the benefits of working for a larger company.The opportunity to learn from more experienced programmers and gain industry experience is worth more to me at this time than being free lance developer. To this end, my main career goal is to find a place of employment at a software engineering company. Ideally my employment would allow me  to develop my skills in back-end web development and other distributed software engineering practices. For a long term goal I would like to explore the possibilities of management, but before then I will need to gain industry experience. I believe finding employment in the games industry in Cornwall will prove to be more challenging than other industries. I would like to stay Cornwall for the next few years, as such, my career seems to be pointed away from the games industry.

\section{Affective Domain: I struggle to control my frustration towards colleagues}
Game development requires many different areas of expertise, as such it attracts people from all walks of life. As such, when I transition into a workplace I may find people whom I do not see eye to eye. The ability to control frustration when difference occur will not only make myself a happier but also stop any negative affects to interpersonal relations. This semester, the different work ethic and schedule of some member of my colleagues has caused me great frustration. My lack of control over this emotion may have caused some members of the team to feel isolated. This isolated feeling may have made it harder for them to return thus negatively impacting both the team and the game. \\
\textbf{S.}    I will download the app called Headspace and complete the ten day basic course.\\
\textbf{M.}   Headspace has a basic ten day course, this course is clearly segmented so I will measure my progress through the app.\\
\textbf{A.}   Having this course available for free and on my phone will give me access to it at anytime with no expense to myself. \\
\textbf{R.}  Building a new habit of meditation into my life should reduce my overall stress. Moreover this course teaches meditation techniques, when I start to become frustrated I can use these techniques to control my frustration.\\
\textbf{T.}  I will start the ten day course on Monday 7th. By the time the rest of my team have returned from the holidays I can put the learned techniques into practice.\\

\section{Interpersonal Domain: Effectively leading a small team}
 Within any industry there is a need for individuals to lead teams. The role to lead may be an official appointed by a company, or through mutually agreement of colleagues. An effective leader can increase productivity in addition to increasing interpersonal relations of the team. This semester I found myself taking on a pseudo-leader role with my colleagues coming to me for advice and guidance. My lack of confidence and knowledge on how to lead made my shy away from the role. Asa result, the structure of our team suffered.\\
\textbf{S.} I will complete the two beginner level tutorials on Lynda.com called \href{https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Managing-Teams-2018/746304-2.html}{``Managing teams''} and  \href{https://www.lynda.com/Leadership-Management-tutorials/Inspirational-leadership/756283/5006410-4.html}{``Leading with emotional intelligence''}. \\
\textbf{M.}  I will measure my progress by how much of the tutorials I have watched. \\
\textbf{A.}  Logging in through Falmouth University's' website allows access to these tutorials for me to watch whenever I have free time, the tutorials are roughly one hour each, although I may have to rewatch parts of interest.\\
\textbf{R.} The tutorials on Lynda.com are of the highest quality. By watching these two tutorials will help me learn techniques to manage teams moreover manage teams with emotional intelligence. \\
\textbf{T.} I will make sure I watch both of the tutorials at least once before my colleagues come back from the Christmas break. This way I can put what I have learned into practice becoming a more effective leader.\\

\section{Dispositional Domain: Managing my break times effectively}
The standard industry practice is to have at least one breaks a day. If one were to start say 9am it is typical to take about a thirty minute break anywhere from about 12-2. This semester, I have found myself coming in at 9am, but not having any consistency when it came to taking a break. Some days I found myself working until about 3 before hunger would drive me away from the computer. Not taking these much needed breaks has caused me some discomfort. When faced a particularly challenging problem I have found it beneficial to take a break and come back with a fresh pair of eyes. \\

\textbf{S.} I will read and practice an advice article by \href{https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/work-breaks-stress-productivity}{Siliconrepublic}.\\
\textbf{M.} I will measure my progress by how often I stick to the advice provided by the article.\\
\textbf{A.}Taking breaks will be difficult when I am engaged with a challenging problem. However, I believe having a clear plan for my breaks will make it much easier to walk away from the problem.\\
\textbf{R.} Having an aim and structure to my break will not only increase the effectiveness of the breaks but also will increase the consistency of when I take the breaks. \\
\textbf{T.} I will make sure I get into the routine of taking regular effective breaks before the end of the academic year. 

\section{Cognitive Domain: To know a framework for lightweight native app development}
 Through speaking with local software engineering professionals I have learnt of the high demand for app development. The demand for cross platform apps is far larger than the demand for games. The frameworks I currently know Unity, UE4  are not suitable for this kind of development. As a result, I had to turn down monetary offers for simple design requests. \\
\textbf{S.} I will complete one beginner and one intermediate Apache Cordova tutorial on Lynda.com .\\
\textbf{M.} I will measure my progress by how much of the tutorials I have watched and understand.\\
\textbf{A.} Once more access to Lynda.com has made this target easy to achieve.\\
\textbf{R.} Apache Cordova allows developers to create native apps using HTML, CSS and Javascript, it is much lighter framework perfect for the kind of apps in demand in Cornwall.\\
\textbf{T.} If I want to make apps for clients I will need have a good understanding of Apache Cordova before I leave university . \\


\section{Procedural Domain: To utilise my C++ knowledge when working in UE4}
After multiple modules where I have had to use C++ I have a good understanding of the language.  However, when working in UE4 I find myself falling on blueprints to do a lot of tasks that can be done in C++. Using C++ instead of blueprints will increase performance as well as further improve my understanding of the language. The value of knowing blueprints is reduced to nothing when applying to companies that do not use UE4.\\
\textbf{S.} I will create the inventory system needed for our came using C++. \\
\textbf{M.} I will measure my progress by how functional and complete the inventory system in my group game is.\\
\textbf{A.} Adding C++ to a UE4 project shared by a team may cause issues which may make it more difficult to complete this target. I have before and will again remind my teammates on how to avoid these issues. \\
\textbf{R.}  By forcing myself to use my knowledge of C++ and UE4 to create this inventory system, I will gain experience and confidence in my C++ skills.\\
\textbf{T.}  I will complete the first version of the inventory system by the end of the first sprint of the second semester.\\

\section{Conclusion}
Learning to control my frustration and learning how to effective lead a small team, will help for my long term goal of taking on a managerial role. Utilising C++ in a complex system,  learning a lightweight  app development framework, and being able to have effective breaks will help me to transition into the kind of companies I specified in my career goals.
